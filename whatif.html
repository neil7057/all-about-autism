                                      the skills themselves are varied in type and degree.

                                    autism through either therapy, medicine or special diet.

                                      to help improve day to day life and mental health.

                                    Some autistic people can speak and communicate verbally, others canâ€™t.
                                     Some autistic people have higher IQs than other people and some have IQ levels within the average range.

                                    Of course speech is only one form of communication but we humans 
                                    seem to think it's everything; so, if you can't talk, you can't communicate (or comprehend).

                                    <p class="myth-card-text">Way back in the 50s,there was a theory "the Refrigerator Mother Hypothesis".
                                        This theory suggested that mothers who were not warm emotionally and could be neglectful or 
                                        distant would traumatise their child so much that it would cause autism.

                                    <p class="myth-card-text">Of course, this completely bogus theory was debunked scientifically decades ago. Unfortunately,
                                        the myth still persists.

                        Presumably in the same way we're all a little bit in a wheelchair or all women are a bit pregnant.

                        It's obviously well meaning but about the worst thing you can say as it underlines in thick lines and bold capitals 
                        that you just don't get the nature of Autism and how it affects those with it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your brain is either wired broadly similarly to everyone else or it isnt. Or it may be broadly similarly
                         wired to another group of the human race. If the number of those people is significantly numerically smaller then it's the exception. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course with so much under diagnosis, late diagnosis and masking, the true number of those "on the spectrum" is difficult to assess 
                        but if it's much larger than currently thought then it could be less statistically "not usual" and more just differently normal.
