## Project Inception and Planning

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand 
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to read about 

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find more information 
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact and ask for help and advice with any questions I may have.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find links to other resources that will help me plan.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added 
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there is any new information.
        3. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new links.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   I've used the main colours of the various Autism icons for the menu items together with the blues and purples used by the National Autism (UK) website to create a warm feel, yet sufficiently bold and with appropriate levels of contrast. The main body background is white with a light blue for headers, footers and margins. 
        
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Inclusive Sans and Open Sans fonts are especially recommended for accessibility so i've chosen those as my main fonts with a default of Sans Serif.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   Each header has a different Autism icon image to celebrate the variety of the Autistic condition. 

        -   The site has additional images where it adds clarity or is the best mechanism to communicate ideas.

    -   #### Design Considerations
        -   The header of each page has a different Autism Icon and remains minimalist, clear and crisp.

        -   Colours are bold and unambiguous.

        -   There are wider margins on each page in larger screen sizes as is common practice in web development. These margins reduce at smaller screen sizes. 

        -   The site is responsive with some items resized for smaller screens.

        -   Menu navigation is consistent across all pages and screen sizes and is central to each page. The menu doesn't change on screen size reduction to maintain consistency which is an important consideration for those 'on the spectrum'. The colours match the various Autism logos and options are highlighted in pink and text font size changes when hovered over.

        -   There is a customised error-404 page 'just in case'.

-   ### **Structure**

    The structure of the site is informed by the the target audience's expectations and the principles of IXD (interaction design) to make sure I was making everything as intuitive as I could. Each page has a clear function and is named to give a clear indication of content/function.


    The site has a simple structure made up of 4 pages:
    * Homepage - A short introduction to Autism and an explanation of the basics.
    * Myths - An exploration of the various myths and misunderstandings of teh Autism condition.
    * Quiz - A fun quiz to test the user's knowledge of Autism. 
    * Comments - A form to allow the user to send comments or requests for further information.

    * There are also 2 additional sub pages:
        -   A Confirmation thank you popup for when a user has submitted a form.
        -   A 404 page for when a user lands on a non-existent page.

    The site has a navbar which remains central to the screen on desktop, tablet and mobile, this allows a user to access any page they need at any time and is suitable for a first time or returning visitor. There is also a footer on every page with links to social media sites and the Comments page.

    Social media links all point to the Autism UK LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter (X), Youtube resources and the main Autism UK website.

## Features

    * This will allow a user to contact me if they have any queries about the NC500, our trip in particular or information to assist in planning their own adventure.
    * To avoid large empty spaces and as i didn't wish to expand the form to the entire screen on laptop screens and above, I have inserted the NC500 logo either side. This is hidden on smaller screen sizes.

### Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 280px and upwards as defined in [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) on the following browsers:
- Chrome    (123.0.6312.106).
- Edge      (123.0.2420.81).
- Firefox   (124.0.2).
- Safari    (17.4).
- Opera     (109.0.5097.24).

Steps to test:

1. Open browser and navigate to
[All About Autiwm](https://neil7057.github.io/all-about-autism/).
2. Open the developer tools (right click and inspect).
3. Set to responsive and decrease width in stages to 280px.
4. Set the zoom to 50%.
5. Click and drag the responsive window to maximum width, noting transitions at breakpoints.
6. Rotate and test for portrait to landscape transition.

Results:

Website is responsive on all screen sizes and no images are pixelated or stretched.
No horizontal scroll is present.
No elements overlap.
Text resizes as expected at breakpoints.
Some content is hidden where it would clutter smaller screens.

Website was also opened on the following devices and no responsive issues were seen:

- iPhone X, 12, 14.
- Apple iPad 12.9.
- Fujitsu 15.4in laptop.
- Hp 22in desktop.

### Accessibility

[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout development
and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

- All forms have associated labels or aria-labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users who tab to form inputs.

- Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in
  [WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).    

- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user.

- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions.

- All non-textual content has alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers.

- HTML page lang attribute has been set.

- Aria properties have been implemented correctly.

- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed.

- Hyperlink text colour has been adjusted to adhere to contrast guidelines.

Results:

### Functional Testing

**Navigation Links**

Testing was performed to ensure all navigation links on the respective pages, navigated to the correct pages as per design.
This was done by clicking on the navigation links on each page on a desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile device.

Links on all pages navigated to the correct pages as expeccted.

**Form Testing**

The form on the contact page was tested to ensure it functioned as expected when correct and incorrect data was input.

Specifically:

-   Missing one or more input field:
    An error was highlighted to the user and the form could not be submitted.

-   Incorrect email format:
    An error was highlighted to the user and the form could not be submitted.

**Links Testing**

Testing was performed to:

-   Open each hyperlink on each page and check that it is a valid URL and opens in a new page.

-   Check on desktop, tablet and mobile.


**Footer Social Media Icons / Links**

Testing was performed on the Font Awesome Social Media icons in the footer to ensure that each one opened in a new tab and that each one
had a 'grow' hover affect of the orange branding color.

Each item opened a new tab when clicked as expected and correct hover effect was present.

**Footer Contact Information**



The email and 'go to' links react when hovered over.

### Further Testing

-   Testing was carried out as each function was developed. The menu structure, navigation and footer were tested until error free on Index.html before propogating to other pages.

-   As each page was completed, existing succesful tests were rerun to ensure that proven functionality hadn't been affected. 

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7/8/X and iPad.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### 404 Error Testing

- A bespoke 404 error page has been created to provide a better user experience.
- This was tested by:
    - navigating to the comments page and changing the address to comment.html in the browser.
    - The dedicated 404-error was displayed and it was possible to navigate home via the home button.

## Deployment

### Version Control

The site was created using the Visual Studio code editor and pushed to the remote repository on GitHub:
‘allaboutautism’.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repository:

```git add <file>``` 
    - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m “commit message”```
    - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

**Following feedback from my mentor, I changed the format of my Git Commit messages to be more industry standard and imperative. This change took effect from commit 31.**

```git push``` 
    - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

### Deployment to Github Pages
