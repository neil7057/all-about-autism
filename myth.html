                            Autism is a spectrum condition and affects people in different ways.
                            Like all people, autistic people have their own strengths and weaknesses.

                                            In fact, no more than 10% of people with autism display some advanced level
                                            of a particular skill. Even among those who do,
                                            the skills themselves are varied in type and degree.

                                        <h2>Myth!</h2>
                                        <p class="myth-card-text">Way back in the 50s,there was a theory "The
                                            Refrigerator Mother Hypothesis".
                                            This theory suggested that mothers who were not warm emotionally and could
                                            be neglectful or
                                            distant would traumatise their child so much that it would cause autism.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="myth-card-text">Of course, this completely bogus theory was debunked
                                            scientifically decades ago. Unfortunately,
                                            the myth still persists.

                            It's obviously well meaning but about the worst thing you can say as it underlines in thick
                            lines and bold capitals
                            that you just don't get the nature of autism and how it affects those with it.

                            Your brain is either wired broadly similarly to everyone else or it isn't. Or it may be
                            broadly similarly
                            wired to another group of the human race. If the number of those people is significantly
                            numerically smaller then it's the exception.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course with so much under diagnosis, late diagnosis and masking, the true number of those
                            "on the spectrum" is difficult to assess
                            but if it's much larger than currently thought then it could be less statistically "not
                            usual" and more just "differently normal".
